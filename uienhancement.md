Responsiveness
--------------

### Principle 1:

Every design starts as a system of **boxes**. The goal is to build a layout where everything has a **clear relationship and natural balance**, so the structure itself feels **flexible** before it ever responds.

### Principle 2:

A responsive layout isn't about **shrinking**—it's about **rearranging with purpose**. As the space changes, elements should **shift, flow, or reprioritize**, maintaining **clarity and rhythm**.

### Section 1: Color Layering for Depth

*   **The Foundation:** Create **3-4 shades** of your base color by increasing **lightness** by **0.1 increments**
    
*   **The Hierarchy Principle:** **Darker** = deeper/background, **Lighter** = elevated/important
    
*   **The Layering Effect:** Stack **lighter shades on top of darker** ones to create **visual elevation**
    
*   No borders needed: **Color contrast alone** can separate elements once you have proper layering
    

### Section 2: Two-Layer Shadows & Gradients

*   **Realism** through **dual shadows**: Combine **light (top) + dark (bottom)** shadows instead of one generic shadow
    
*   **Three depth levels:** **Small** shadow (subtle), **medium** shadow (standard), **large** shadow (prominent hover/focus)
    
*   **Light from above concept:** Simulate **natural lighting**—**lighter on top, darker on bottom**
    
*   **Gradient enhancement:** **Linear gradients** + **light inner shadow on top** = shiny, elevated effect
    
*   **Inset vs outset:** **Inset** shadows push in (sunken), **outset** shadows lift up (raised)
